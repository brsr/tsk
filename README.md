This code was written forever ago. It runs and produces valid results, but may not be written in a contemporary R idiom.

This packaged was formerly located at https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/tskarber/ . The R-forge project is being kept around to direct existing users (all 5 of them) here. All future updates will happen on Github.
