#The original goal of this R package was to replicate the results
#of a DOS program that used to be provided by the EPA to perform
#the trimmed Spearman-Karber method. The list "expected" contains 
#the results of that DOS program run on the data from Hamilton et al.

#Some of these are NA because the EPA program didn't return a result.

#The EPA program uses a confidence of 2*pnorm(2)-1=0.9544997
#(that is, exactly two sigmas on both sides).
